      <h2>
        Hello! My name is Oskar Arslanov and here i would like to share my life
        experience
      </h2>
      <h3>School days</h3>
      <p>
        In my childhood, until the age of 14, I studied at Gymnasium â„–90 in the
        city of Kazan, Russia. During my time there, I didn&apos;t do anything
        particularly special; I focused on my schoolwork and played football. I
        was almost qualified as a sports master, which is a significant
        achievement in Russia. I played for the 2nd FC &quot;Rubin&quot; junior
        team and won numerous championships in my town and state, the Republic
        of Tatarstan. Finally, I graduated from school with a GPA of 4.55/5.
      </p>
      <h3>College</h3>
      <p>
        After completing 9th grade, I enrolled in college and pursued a 4-year
        program in computer technology. During my second year of college, I
        decided to invest in my future and began self-studying computer
        administration based on Linux. I used resources such as YouTube and
        books from the college library. However, after about 3-4 months, I grew
        tired of studying on my own. One day, I attended additional education
        courses in college called &quot;WorldSkills Mobile Robotics.&quot; I had
        a growing interest in IT science, so I decided to give it a try. At the
        time, I had no specific knowledge about robotics, including soldering,
        but fortunately, it was a team competition, and I wanted to be the
        programmer on the team. Over the next six months, I taught myself how to
        program robotics using <Link href="https://www.ni.com">LabVIEW</Link>{' '}
        and became a participant in the WorldSkills National Competition.
      </p>
      <h3>EuroSkills</h3>
      <p>
        I won it as a member of the state team. Following the National
        Competition, I competed with other candidates to represent Russia on the
        national team and emerged victorious. In December 2016, I received my
        first international award at EuroSkills in Sweden, Gothenburg.
      </p>
      <h3>WorldSkills</h3>
      <p>
        After EuroSkills, I participated in numerous National Competitions
        abroad, including China, Japan, India, South Korea, Belarus, and Hong
        Kong, all in preparation for WorldSkills International 2019 in Kazan, my
        hometown. In March 2019, I trained in{' '}
        <Link href="https://meister.hrdkorea.or.kr/eng/html/committee/GIFTS.do">
          South Korea with the Samsung team for a month{' '}
        </Link>{' '}
        . During this time, we had a local competition, where I unfortunately
        placed second. In August 2019, the WorldSkills International competition
        began. I was not nervous because I had invested a lot of time preparing
        my soft skills and knew I had done everything possible. My teammate and
        I did not make any mistakes during the competition, but China and South
        Korea&apos;s teams were faster and earned more points. I ultimately
        received a bronze medal in the WSI competition in 2019.

      <h3>Becoming programmer</h3>
      <p>
        After EuroSkills and WorldSkills, I had the opportunity to meet V.V.
        Putin, though today, it doesn&apos;t hold the same significance.
        Throughout 2020, I took a mental vacation, but in February 2021, I
        received an invitation to work as a Technical Director for WorldSkills
        Sakhalin. Unfortunately, the offer came with a low salary and limited
        prospects, so I declined. Later, in July, I received another invitation
        to work as a Robotics and Mechatronics teacher at the Moscow Government
        Education Complex. This led me to change my life, move to Moscow, and
        begin my journey towards becoming a real programmer, focusing on the
        Java language. Over the course of a year, I taught students and
        self-studied Java and the Spring Framework. I also started courses on
        Javarush and coached my WorldSkills team in Moscow. Within just one
        year, I coached the winners of the Russia National Competition in Mobile
        Robotics, using Java 11 as the new robotics platform required it.
        Unfortunately, in 2022, Russia became involved in a war with Ukraine,
        and everything turned grim. However, I continued my studies. In July
        2022, I realized that becoming a Junior Java Developer was a valuable
        path, so I began studying TypeScript and React. Thanks to my older
        brother, who is a Senior Frontend Developer at{' '}
        <Link href="https://www.orioninc.com/">Orion innovation</Link>, I
        secured my first job as a programmer in September 2022. In October, I
        moved to Kazakhstan with my wife.
